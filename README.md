# MPhil & PhD Lifecycle Management System

---
The MPhil & PhD Lifecycle Management System is a faculty-level, web-based platform designed to **manage and track postgraduate research students throughout their entire academic journey**. It replaces fragmented document handling and email-based coordination with a centralized, structured, and transparent system.

The platform supports the complete research lifecycle, including,
- student registration
- supervisor assignment
- research proposal submission and approvals
- periodic progress reviews
- ethics clearance tracking
- thesis submission and examination management 

Role-based access ensures clear separation of views and responsibilities for **postgraduate students**, **supervisors**, **coordinators**, and **faculty administrators**.

## Key features 
- secure document storage with version control
- automated milestone reminders and notifications
- audit trails for academic decisions
- analytical dashboards for monitoring student progress and supervisor workloads. 

Built with long-term data consistency, compliance, and scalability in mind, the system aims to significantly **reduce administrative overhead** while improving governance and regulatory adherence within postgraduate research management.
